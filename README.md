ðŸª› Tools needed: triangle screwdriver, diagonal cutters or similar tool to cut wires, bluetack

Steps:
1. Buy the happy meal toy on ebay

2. Buy a Raspberry Pi Zero 2W, Pimoroni Display HAT mini or 3.5" LCD Touchscreen for Raspberry Pi. I bought the Raspberry Pi Zero 2W and soldered on the 40 pin header (oof)

3. Open up device and time to cut out the pcb
