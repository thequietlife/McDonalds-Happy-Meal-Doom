## Playing Doom on a McDonalds happy meal toy

A run through of a weird project I found online. [Playing Doom on a McDonaldâ€™s happy meal toy](https://youtu.be/4DH9DLzvx5Y?si=JyPXOHTMZptnwwKq)

ðŸª› Tools needed: triangle screwdriver, diagonal cutters or similar tool to cut wires, bluetack

Steps:
1. Buy the nugget tetris McDonalds happy meal toy on ebay

2. Buy a Raspberry Pi Zero 2W, Pimoroni Display HAT mini or 3.5" LCD Touchscreen for Raspberry Pi. I bought the Raspberry Pi Zero 2W and soldered on the 40 pin header (oof)

3. Open up device and time to cut out the pcb

4. One of the cool things about this project was using old tech I had lying around, like the micro SD card adapter, from my Raspberry Pi 2

5. Raspbian install

6. Wait what? oof the header needs to be soldered on. This [YT video](https://youtu.be/UDdbaMk39tM?si=J9jkcMfrUf6U2EmM) by Bas van der Sluis saved me ðŸ«¡

The soldering is not pretty but it works

7. It was really cool seeing the LCD mirroring the Raspberry Pi desktop
